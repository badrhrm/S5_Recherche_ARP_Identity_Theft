# S5_Recherche_ARP_Identity_Theft
Research Assignment for S5

The objective of the assignment was to explore and learn more about ARP identity theft and write about it.

Instead of using a regular Google search, I used Google Scholar to find research papers and articles related to the subject. I then spent time reading various documents to understand the topic better and decide on my writing structure and subheadings. After selecting the primary papers and articles to use, I studied and explored each one of them in detail so I could synthesize them in my "research review document".

Although we have not yet had classes related to academic research, academic paper writing, or other academic things, I believe I took a significant first step by using Google Scholar instead of regular Google and relying on academic papers and articles for learning and extracting information rather than regular Google articles.
